Happy Birthday Aarushi.
You are one of the best people I met in college.
In programmer's language,
"In my Array() of interests, your position is number one."



"On your birthday, I wish you endless lines of efficient code, seamless debugging sessions, and a lifetime of fulfilling programming projects. May the compilers always be in your favor, and the syntax errors be minimal. May each line you write bring you closer to your dreams and aspirations. Here's to a future filled with groundbreaking innovations and countless opportunities for growth. Happy birthday, my programmer friend. May your path be paved with success and your code forever elegant!"
